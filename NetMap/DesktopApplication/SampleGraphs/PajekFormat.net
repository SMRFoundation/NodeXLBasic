/* here:
/*
/*     http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/doc/pajekman.pdf.
/*
/* A Pajek file consists of one or more sections that start with a section
/* header.  A section header starts with an asterisk in column 1.

/* The "*vertices" section specifies the graph's vertices.  The header includes
/* the vertex count.

*vertices 14

/* The header is followed by one line per vertex.  The first field of each
/* vertex line is a one-based index that must range from 1 to the vertex count.
/* The second field of each vertex line is the vertex name surrounded by double
/* quotes.  (Fields in Pajek are separated by any combination of spaces and
/* tabs.)  The vertex name may optionally be followed by the vertex's x- y- and
/* z-coordinates, which must range from 0 to 1.0.

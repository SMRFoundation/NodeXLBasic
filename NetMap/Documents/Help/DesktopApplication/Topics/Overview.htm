Microsoft .NetMap is a desktop application that displays graphs, which are
collections of vertices connected by edges.  Here is a sample graph:
</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../Images/SampleGraph.jpg" width="536" height="530"></p>

<p>
.NetMap can read graphs in several file formats, lay them out using one of
several layout algorithms, and display them with a variety of display options.  An Excel add-in allows graph data entered in an Excel worksheet to be easily
displayed in .NetMap.
</p>

<p>
The components used to develop the .NetMap application are available as an API
for developers who want to create and display graphs in their own applications.
See the NetMapApi.chm help file in the .NetMap application directory for details.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft .NetMap was created by Marc Smith's team at Microsoft
Research.  It was written in C#.

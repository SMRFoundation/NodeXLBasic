
This project builds several classes that implement the
Microsoft.NodeXL.ExcelTemplatePlugIns.IGraphDataProvider interface.   These
classes are plugins for the NodeXL Excel template.  They import graph data into
the template from data sources that the template doesn't know about.

See the IGraphDataProvider interface for details.

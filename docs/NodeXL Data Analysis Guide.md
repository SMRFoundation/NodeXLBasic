# Network analysis in NodeXL usually requires a set of steps to prepare data for analysis.

## NodeXL Data Analysis Task List: Steps for data import, scrub, analysis, and visualization

Most data analysis tasks with NodeXL will follow a common set of steps:

    * Import
    * Merge duplicate edges
    * Calculate (ALL) network metrics
    * Create clusters
    * Insert sub-graph images
    * Sort edge list in a way that usefully effects the order of layout in the graph display
    * Auto-fill columns (and map data to display attributes): Set shape, color, opacity, size, and label/tooltip
    * Show graph
    * Read workbook
    * Adjust layout
    * Dynamic Filters â€“ selectively hide edges and nodes
    * Layout Again
    * Return to spreadsheet to sort or calculate data
    * Integrate additional edge lists


To regenerate the GraphServer.cs proxy file, follow these steps:

1. Open a Visual Studio command prompt window.

2. At the command prompt, navigate to this
   NodeXL\GraphDataProviders\NetworkAnalyzers\GraphServer folder.

3. On the command line, enter this:

    svcutil http://localhost/GraphService/GraphService.svc /synconly


NOTE:

The "/synconly" flag is critical.  If you leave it off, the proxy file will
include asynchronous methods that use the System.Threading.Tasks.Task class.
That isn't a problem on client computers that have .NET Framework 4.5, but for
client computers that only have .NET Framework 4.0, attempting to import a
network from the Graph Server will raise an InvalidDataContract exception that
includes the text "Type 'System.Threading.Tasks.Task' ... cannot be
serialized."
